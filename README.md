# Work-Day-Scheduler
# Description
I created a simple app that allows the user to keep track of important events during their work day 

This app will allow the user to input information in the itinerary sectiob of the table and then save it using the corresponding button 

# Uses
When the application is opened the user is presented with the current date as well as the table for them to store their daily tasks 

the table is broken up into rows which corresponding to the 9-5 work schedule, an input field to into information, and a button to save that information

When the user clicks into the input field they will be able to enter their information 

The user can then click onto the save button to save this information to Localstorage 

# Features

The table uses Javascript to color code the timeblocks to represent past,present, and future events for the user. 

Clicking the save button saves the event in the corresponding input field and allows those fields to persist even between refreshes
